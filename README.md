# 🔮 Speckle

**Spec-driven development with persistent memory.**

Speckle bridges [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) specifications with 
[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issue tracking, providing workflow continuity 
and memory across AI agent sessions.

## Why Speckle?

| Without Speckle | With Speckle |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Tasks in markdown, no tracking | Tasks synced to beads with dependencies |
| "Where was I?" each session | `bd ready` shows exactly what's next |
| Lost implementation context | Comments preserve decisions and progress |
| Manual status updates | Bidirectional sync keeps everything aligned |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install beads
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Install spec-kit  
pipx install "specify-cli @ git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git"

# Initialize in your project
specify init . --ai claude
bd init
```

### Install Speckle

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/JulianDouma/Speckle.git /tmp/speckle
/tmp/speckle/install.sh /path/to/your/project

# Verify installation
/tmp/speckle/install.sh --check /path/to/your/project

# Restart your AI agent to load commands
```

#### Installer Options

```bash
./install.sh [OPTIONS] [TARGET_DIR]

Options:
  --help, -h      Show help message
  --version, -v   Show version
  --check         Run health check only
  --uninstall     Remove Speckle from target
  --force         Skip prerequisite warnings
  --quiet, -q     Minimal output
```

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create specification (spec-kit)
/speckit.specify "Add user authentication"

# 2. Create plan (spec-kit)
/speckit.plan "Go, PostgreSQL, JWT"

# 3. Create tasks (spec-kit)
/speckit.tasks

# 4. Sync to beads (Speckle!)
/speckle.sync

# 5. Implement with tracking (Speckle!)
/speckle.implement

# 6. Check progress
/speckle.status
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/speckle.sync` | Bidirectional sync between tasks.md and beads |
| `/speckle.implement` | Implement next ready task with progress tracking |
| `/speckle.status` | Show epic progress and health |
| `/speckle.progress` | Add manual progress note to current task |

## Formulas

Speckle includes beads formulas for quickly starting new features or bugfixes:

### Create a Feature

```bash
bd formula speckle-feature "User Authentication"
```

This creates:
- A feature branch (e.g., `001-user-authentication`)
- Spec directory structure (`specs/001-user-authentication/`)
- Epic issue for tracking

**Example output:**
```
✅ Feature created: User Authentication

📁 Branch: 001-user-authentication
📂 Specs: specs/001-user-authentication/
🎫 Epic: speckle-abc

Next steps:
  /speckit.specify "Add user authentication"
```

### Create a Bugfix

```bash
bd formula speckle-bugfix "Login fails on mobile"
```

This creates:
- A bugfix branch (e.g., `fix-login-fails-on-mobile`)
- Bug issue with severity tracking

**Example output:**
```
✅ Bugfix created: Login fails on mobile

📁 Branch: fix-login-fails-on-mobile
🐛 Issue: speckle-xyz
⚠️  Severity: medium

Next steps:
  1. Reproduce the bug
  2. Write a failing test
  3. Fix and verify
  4. bd close speckle-xyz
```

## Bugfix Workflow

For quick bug fixes that don't require full spec-kit planning, use the bugfix commands:

### Standard Bugfix

```bash
/speckle.bugfix "Login fails on mobile Safari"
```

This creates a lightweight bugfix workflow:
- Creates a fix branch (e.g., `fix-login-fails-on-mobile-safari`)
- Creates a bug issue with severity tracking
- Skips spec-kit overhead for simple fixes

**Example output:**
```
✅ Bugfix branch created

📁 Branch: fix-login-fails-on-mobile-safari
🐛 Issue: speckle-abc
⚠️  Severity: medium

Workflow:
  1. Reproduce the bug
  2. Write a failing test
  3. Implement the fix
  4. Verify all tests pass
  5. bd close speckle-abc
```

### Urgent Hotfix

For critical production issues requiring immediate attention:

```bash
/speckle.hotfix "Payment processing timeout in checkout"
```

This creates an urgent hotfix workflow:
- Creates a hotfix branch (e.g., `hotfix-payment-processing-timeout`)
- Creates a critical-severity issue
- Prioritizes the fix in `bd ready`

**Example output:**
```
🚨 HOTFIX branch created

📁 Branch: hotfix-payment-processing-timeout
🐛 Issue: speckle-xyz
🔴 Severity: critical

Workflow:
  1. Reproduce the issue
  2. Implement minimal fix
  3. Verify fix works
  4. bd close speckle-xyz
  5. Merge immediately
```

### When to Use Each

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Feature development | `/speckit.specify` + `/speckle.sync` |
| Non-urgent bug | `/speckle.bugfix` |
| Production incident | `/speckle.hotfix` |

## Issue Creation Workflow

Create issues using a structured, guided approach that syncs with both GitHub Issues and beads:

### Guided Issue Creation

```bash
/speckle.issue "Add dark mode support"
```

This walks you through:
1. **Classify** - Select issue type (feature, bug, enhancement, chore, docs)
2. **Describe** - Add detailed description
3. **Prioritize** - Set severity (for bugs) or priority
4. **Link** - Optionally link to an existing spec or create a new one
5. **Create** - Generates GitHub issue with proper template
6. **Sync** - Automatically syncs to beads for unified tracking

**Example output:**
```
✅ Issue created successfully!

📋 Summary:
   Title: Add dark mode support
   Type: feature
   GitHub: https://github.com/user/repo/issues/42
   Beads: speckle-abc

🎯 Next steps:
   1. Create feature: bd formula speckle-feature "Add dark mode support"
   2. Develop spec: /speckit.specify
   3. Plan: /speckit.plan
   4. Tasks: /speckit.tasks
   5. Sync: /speckle.sync
```

### Issue Templates

Speckle includes GitHub Issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

| Template | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `feature.md` | New functionality requests |
| `bug.md` | Bug reports with severity tracking |
| `enhancement.md` | Improvements to existing features |
| `chore.md` | Maintenance and housekeeping tasks |
| `docs.md` | Documentation updates |

### Issue Triage

Review and prioritize issues across GitHub and beads:

```bash
/speckle.triage
```

**Dashboard view** shows issue counts and sync status:
```
📊 Speckle Issue Triage Dashboard
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📌 GitHub Issues
   Open: 12
   Bugs: 3
   Features: 5

🔮 Beads Issues
   Open: 10
   In Progress: 2
   Blocked: 1

⚠️  Potential Issues:
   2 GitHub issue(s) not synced to beads
   Run: /speckle.triage --sync
```

**Options:**

```bash
/speckle.triage --sync    # Sync all open GitHub issues to beads
/speckle.triage --review  # Interactive review of issues
/speckle.triage --stale   # Find stale issues needing attention
```

### When to Use Each

| Scenario | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Quick bug report | `/speckle.bugfix` |
| Detailed issue (any type) | `/speckle.issue` |
| Review issue backlog | `/speckle.triage` |
| Complex feature | `/speckle.issue` → `/speckit.specify` |

## Kanban Board

Visualize your beads issues in a web-based kanban board:

```bash
/speckle.board
```

This opens a browser with a 4-column kanban view:

| Column | Status | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| BACKLOG | open | Ready to work on |
| IN PROGRESS | in_progress | Currently being worked |
| BLOCKED | blocked | Waiting on something |
| DONE | closed | Completed (last 15) |

**Options:**

```bash
/speckle.board --port 3000        # Custom port
/speckle.board --filter "v1.2.0"  # Filter by label
/speckle.board --no-browser       # Don't auto-open browser
/speckle.board --refresh 10       # 10 second refresh
```

**Features:**
- Priority color coding (P0-P4)
- Type badges (task, bug, feature, epic)
- Label filtering via dropdown
- Auto-refresh (default: 5 seconds)
- Responsive layout for tablet/mobile

## Troubleshooting

Use the doctor command to diagnose issues:

```bash
/speckle.doctor
```

**Example output:**
```
🩺 Speckle Doctor

```

## How It Works

```
Spec-Kit                    Speckle                     Beads
─────────                   ───────                     ─────
spec.md    ─────────┐
plan.md    ─────────┼──→  /speckle.sync  ──────→  issues.jsonl
tasks.md   ─────────┘         ↕                      ↕
                         .speckle-mapping.json    bd ready
                              ↕                    bd close
                         /speckle.implement  ←──  bd comments
```

## Memory Across Sessions

Every implementation is automatically recorded as a bead comment:

```bash
# View implementation history for a task
bd comments <issue-id>

# Example output:
# ## Implementation Complete
# **Task:** T001
# **Actor:** claude
# **Time:** 2026-02-09T19:30:00Z
# 
# ### Changes
# - Lines added: +150
# - Lines removed: -20
# - Files changed: 3

# Add manual progress notes during implementation
/speckle.progress "Chose Redis over Memcached for caching"

# Check overall feature status
/speckle.status
```

This means every new session can pick up exactly where the last one left off.

### Filtering by Labels

When Speckle syncs tasks to beads, labels are applied automatically based on spec metadata.
Use `bd list --label` to filter tasks:

```bash
# Filter by phase (from spec headers)
bd list --label phase:foundation
bd list --label phase:mvp

# Filter by feature (from branch name)
bd list --label feature:auth

# Filter by story  
bd list --label story:us1

# Combine multiple labels (AND - must have ALL)
bd list --label phase:foundation --label docs

# OR filtering (must have AT LEAST ONE)
bd list --label-any phase:foundation,phase:mvp

# Short form
bd list -l docs
```

Common label patterns:
- `phase:<phase-name>` - Development phase from spec headers
- `story:<story-id>` - User story association
- `feature:<name>` - Feature from branch name
- `docs` - Documentation tasks
- `v0.3.0` - Version/milestone labels

## Self-Hosted Development

Speckle is developed using Speckle! From v0.2.0 onwards, each version is built 
using the previous version, validating the tool while improving it.
