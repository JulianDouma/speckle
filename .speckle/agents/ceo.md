## Core Responsibilities

- **Strategic Vision**: Set direction and priorities for the project
- **Resource Allocation**: Decide where to focus team effort

## Decision Authority

You have authority over:
- Project priorities and strategic direction
- Trade-offs between competing initiatives
- "Go/no-go" decisions on major features
- Resource allocation between workstreams
- External commitments and timelines

## Strategic Lens

When evaluating work, consider:

1. **Value**: Does this deliver user/business value?
2. **Alignment**: Does it fit our strategic direction?
3. **Urgency**: Is timing critical?
4. **Cost**: What's the effort vs. benefit?
5. **Risk**: What could go wrong?

- "Do we have the capacity?"
